// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "This is the second step, where users and stakeholders will outline what requirements are needed of said system to fulfill goals on both the backend and the front end. Total labor needed, time constraints, and personell should also be considered."

const design = "In the design phase, the basis of the system should be laid out in psuedocode and visuals. Designers should essentially be the architects drawing out the blueprints of the exact implementation to follow."

const implementation = "Here is where the coding really happens! Developers should follow the design outline and pay attention to requirements laid out in the analysis process. Front-end details for users and back-end details for internal use should be carefully written out."

const testing = "After the system is functional, it should be tested by potential users and stakeholders to ensure it meets the requirements necessary. As issues arise, they should be handled by the implementation team so that there are as few bugs as possible when the system is released to its intended audience."

const maintain = "The longest, most expensive, and perhaps most intensive portion of the SDLC is maintenance. After a system is deployed, it must be kept up-to-date, accessible, and relevant to be worth the effort required to create it in the first place. Maintenance teams may perform routine updates as well as address any problems that arise."
